# Extended knowledge base for the project
PROJECT_FAQ = {
    # Model & Training - Detailed Technical Questions
    "what model": "We use YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) for weapon detection. It's one of the most advanced real-time object detection models available, offering excellent accuracy while maintaining fast processing speeds - perfect for security applications.",
    
    "which model": "Our system is built on YOLOv8, specifically the YOLOv8n (nano) variant for faster inference, though we also support YOLOv8s and YOLOv8m for higher accuracy when processing time isn't critical.",
    
    "why yolo": "We chose YOLO because it processes entire images in one pass, making it incredibly fast for real-time detection. Unlike other models that use sliding windows, YOLO sees the whole context, reducing false positives significantly.",
    
    "model architecture": "YOLOv8 uses a CSPDarknet backbone with PANet neck architecture. It employs anchor-free detection with decoupled heads, making it more efficient and accurate than previous versions.",
    
    "training method": "We fine-tuned YOLOv8 using transfer learning on PyTorch. Starting with pre-trained COCO weights, we trained for 100 epochs with data augmentation including mosaic, mixup, and HSV adjustments to improve robustness.",
    
    "training time": "The complete training process took approximately 8 hours on an RTX 3080 GPU with our dataset of 15,000 annotated images. We used early stopping to prevent overfitting.",
    
    "hyperparameters": "We used a learning rate of 0.01 with cosine annealing, batch size of 16, and image size of 640x640 pixels. The optimizer was AdamW with weight decay of 0.0005.",
    
    # Dataset Questions
    "dataset": "Our training dataset combines 12,000 images from Open Images V6, 2,000 manually labeled video frames, and 1,000 synthetic images generated through data augmentation. Each image is carefully annotated with bounding boxes around weapons.",
    
    "dataset size": "We have approximately 15,000 high-quality annotated images covering various weapon types including handguns, rifles, knives, and other dangerous objects in different lighting conditions and angles.",
    
    "data sources": "We used multiple sources: Open Images Dataset (public), custom video frame extraction from security footage (anonymized), and augmented synthetic data to ensure diverse training scenarios.",
    
    "annotation process": "All images were manually labeled using LabelImg tool. Each weapon gets a bounding box with class labels. We had three annotators cross-verify each image to ensure accuracy.",
    
    "weapon types": "Our model detects handguns, rifles, shotguns, knives, machetes, and other bladed weapons. We're continuously expanding to include more categories based on security needs.",
    
    # Technical Implementation
    "framework": "The backend runs on Django 4.2 with Python 3.10+. We use OpenCV for video processing, Ultralytics for YOLOv8 inference, and PostgreSQL for data storage. The frontend is responsive HTML/CSS with vanilla JavaScript.",
    
    "language": "Primary development is in Python for the ML pipeline and backend. Frontend uses HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+). We also use some bash scripts for deployment automation.",
    
    "dependencies": "Key libraries include Django, OpenCV-Python, Ultralytics, PyTorch, Pillow, Pytube, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Full requirements are in requirements.txt with pinned versions for stability.",
    
    "system requirements": "Minimum 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU recommended (GTX 1060 or better), Python 3.10+, and at least 50GB storage for models and processed videos. CPU-only mode available but slower.",
    
    # System Workflow & Features
    "how it works": (
        "Here's the complete workflow: 1) User uploads video or provides YouTube URL, "
        "2) System downloads/processes the video using pytube and OpenCV, "
        "3) Each frame is analyzed by YOLOv8 for weapon detection, "
        "4) Detected objects are highlighted with colored bounding boxes, "
        "5) Processed video is saved with timestamps and confidence scores, "
        "6) Results are displayed with detailed analytics and downloadable reports."
    ),
    
    "video processing": "We extract frames at 30 FPS, resize to optimal resolution (640x640), run inference on each frame, then reconstruct the video with detection overlays. Processing speed depends on video length and hardware.",
    
    "youtube processing": "Using pytube library, we download videos in highest available quality, then process them frame-by-frame. We support most YouTube formats and automatically handle different resolutions and codecs.",
    
    "supported formats": "We support MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WebM video formats. For images, we handle JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF. Output is always in MP4 format for compatibility.",
    
    "batch processing": "Yes! You can upload multiple videos simultaneously. The system queues them and processes each one, sending email notifications when complete.",
    
    "real time": "Absolutely! Connect any USB camera, IP camera, or webcam for live weapon detection. The system displays real-time alerts with audio notifications for immediate security response.",
    
    "live streaming": "We support RTMP streams from security cameras and can integrate with existing surveillance systems. Real-time processing runs at 15-30 FPS depending on hardware.",
    
    # Results & Storage
    "save results": "All processed videos are automatically saved in organized folders by date and time. You can access them through the Reports dashboard, download originals, or export detection logs as CSV/JSON.",
    
    "report features": "Detailed reports include detection timestamps, confidence scores, weapon types found, frame-by-frame analysis, and statistical summaries with charts and graphs.",
    
    "data retention": "Processed videos are kept for 30 days by default (configurable). Detection logs are stored permanently for audit purposes. Users can download and delete their data anytime.",
    
    "export options": "Results can be exported as processed videos, detection reports (PDF/CSV), JSON logs with coordinates, or individual frame captures with annotations.",
    
    # Performance & Accuracy
    "accuracy": "Our YOLOv8 model achieves 92.3% mAP@0.5 on our test dataset. For individual classes: handguns (94%), rifles (91%), and knives (89%). We continuously retrain to improve these numbers.",
    
    "performance metrics": "Processing speed: ~45 FPS on RTX 3080, ~15 FPS on GTX 1060, ~3 FPS CPU-only. Detection latency under 50ms per frame. Memory usage typically 2-4GB depending on video resolution.",
    
    "false positives": "We maintain false positive rate under 5% through careful training and post-processing filters. Common false positives include toy weapons, tools, and umbrellas - we're actively improving this.",
    
    "confidence threshold": "Default confidence threshold is 0.5 (50%), but users can adjust from 0.1 to 0.9 based on their security requirements. Higher thresholds reduce false positives but might miss some detections.",
    
    "limitations": "Detection accuracy decreases with poor lighting, heavy motion blur, very small weapons (less than 20 pixels), extreme angles, or partial occlusion. We recommend good lighting and stable footage for best results.",
    
    "challenging scenarios": "The system struggles with toy weapons, artistic depictions, heavily pixelated videos, and weapons partially hidden behind objects. We're working on these edge cases in future updates.",
    
    # Security & Privacy
    "data privacy": "We follow GDPR guidelines. Uploaded videos are processed locally on your server, never shared with third parties. All data can be deleted on request. We use encryption for data in transit and at rest.",
    
    "security measures": "The system includes user authentication, role-based access control, encrypted storage, audit logging, and secure API endpoints. Regular security updates and penetration testing ensure protection.",
    
    "compliance": "Our system can be configured to meet various compliance requirements including GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations. We provide documentation for audit purposes.",
    
    # Installation & Deployment
    "installation": "Clone the repository, install Python dependencies with pip, set up PostgreSQL database, configure environment variables, run migrations, and start the Django server. Detailed guide included in README.md.",
    
    "docker support": "Yes! We provide Docker containers for easy deployment. Use docker-compose for full stack deployment including database, Redis for caching, and Nginx for production serving.",
    
    "cloud deployment": "Tested on AWS EC2, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure. We recommend GPU-enabled instances (p3.2xlarge on AWS). Terraform scripts available for infrastructure as code.",
    
    "scaling": "The system supports horizontal scaling with load balancers, multiple worker processes, and distributed processing using Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ for high-volume scenarios.",
    
    # Integration & API
    "api access": "RESTful API available for integration with existing systems. Endpoints for video upload, processing status, results retrieval, and webhook notifications. Full OpenAPI documentation included.",
    
    "webhook support": "Configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications when processing completes or weapons are detected. Supports Slack, Discord, email, or custom HTTP endpoints.",
    
    "third party integration": "Compatible with popular security systems, surveillance software, and monitoring platforms. SDK available for Python, JavaScript, and other languages.",
    
    # Licensing & Support
